# Cortex

Cortex is a modern, decentralized platform for managing autonomous organizations with a focus 
on user privacy by leveraging zero-knowledge technologies.

By incorporating Risc0 zkVM into the application flows, we can:
* Anonymize user's votes
* Validate off-chain transactions, including transactions on other chains.
* Validate off-chain assets for authenticity
* Validate merkle trees of off-chain arbitrary data
* And much moreâ„¢
